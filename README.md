# freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Certificate

These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

## Projects

### Rock Paper Scissors

Plays the game Rock Paper Scissors. The program works by keeping track of sets of moves (I set it to 7 in the program as this seemed to work well). It then predicts the next move by looking at the previous 6, making combinations for the possible moves, and seeing which one occured the highest.

### Cat and Dog Image Classifier

Uses a convolutional neural network to make predictions on images of cats and dogs. The program is implemented using Python, Tensorflow, and Keras. I did not write the program locally, instead I used Google Colab starting from boilerplate provided by freeCodeCamp. My project can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EDdNHLyxvXSt_o9OObPdII-g4WfKZM8z?usp=sharing), and a local copy is available in this repo.

### Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

Recommends books using a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. When a book title is inputted, the program will return books that are similar based on the distance found by the algorithm. I wrote the program using Google Colab, accessible [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fd1kH5vDAcSE6qjiR0VrI2vQ6KU5rrFL?usp=sharing) or locally in this repo.
